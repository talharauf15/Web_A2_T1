**HTML Structure**: Create two separate HTML files, one for SignIn and one for SignUp. Each file should contain a form with the necessary input fields. The SignIn form should have fields for username and password, while the SignUp form should have at least 8 fields of different types (such as text, password, email, number, etc.) to demonstrate various data inputs.
**CSS Styling**: Use CSS to style your forms. This could be in a separate CSS file that you link to your HTML files. You can style your forms however you like, but make sure they are user-friendly and intuitive.
**JavaScript Validation**: Use JavaScript to validate the input fields in your forms. You can do this by writing a function that is called when the form is submitted. This function should check that all fields are filled out and that the input meets certain criteria. For example, you can use regular expressions (regex) to check that the password contains special and numeric characters, that the email address is in a valid format, and that the age is a valid number within a specified range. If the input is not valid, the function should prevent the form from being submitted and alert the user to the problem.
Here are some examples of input field validations you could implement:

**Input Field should not be empty**: Check that the value of the input field is not an empty string ("").
**Password must contain special and numeric characters**: Use a regex to check that the password contains at least one special character and one numeric character.
**Email address must be in a valid format**: Use a regex to check that the email address is in a valid format (e.g., name@example.com).
**Age must be a valid number or within a specified range**: Check that the age is a number and is within a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 120).
